## How does it work?
InstaTracker uses the Android-Instagram API to login into your Instagram account.
Then you can search for any user to save their current followers, following and fans.
At a later date you can compare the current state of any user to any previosly saved state.

### Search
InstaTracker allows you to save the followers, following and fans of any Instagram account to compare at a later date and time.
But you can only save the stats of public profiles or profiles you follow.

### Account
InstaTracker has to login to your Instagram account to fetch API data.
You can create a new account for this or you can use your exisisting account which is not recommended if 'Save account' is enabled.
You may get a natification that says some random Android device has logged into your account, dont worry!

### Settings
Of course you can customize InstaTracker for example you can enable 'Save account' and 'Auto logn' to automatically save new accounts you add and automatically log into them as soon as you launch the app.

### Info
When pressing onto an searched account a new info page will get loaded. Here you can see some account data like follower and followings count. With the chip cards you can switch between the tabs 'Followers', 'Following' and 'Fans', which show a full user list of the account.
By pressing the '=' icon on the top you can compare different states to each other. New users will be shown green and removed users will be red.
